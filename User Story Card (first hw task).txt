As an administrator of the game, I want to have a button which delete a player from the game as a punishment after breaking the rules of the game or harm other participants. 
 • The Button shouldn't be visible to any other participants.
 • After I click on the button, the program has to confirm that it wasn't an accidental click.
 • Participant who has been removed from the game has have a message on their screen with a message from administrator (me) with a reason. 
 • Player's data has to be deleted after the player was removed.

As an Admin i want to have an access to restore Participant if he promise that he would never break the rules again.
